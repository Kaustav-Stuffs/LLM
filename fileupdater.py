#     You are an expert at processing text and generating structured JSON output for the SFA (Salesforce Automation) application FAQs. Given the following paragraph or summary, your task is to intelligently split the content into multiple FAQ-style entries if it contains information about more than one topic, question, or answer. Each entry should match the JSON schema below and focus on a single question and answer pair.

#     **JSON Schema Example**:
#     ```json
#     {{
#         "text": "Question: What is the purpose of the SFA application? Answer: The SFA application helps track client visits, schedule meetings, record expenses, and manage salesforce tasks digitally.",
#         "metadata": {{
#             "source": "sfa_faq",
#             "category": "Overview",
#             "keywords": ["SFA", "purpose", "salesforce", "track", "meetings", "expenses", "client visits"]
#         }}
#     }}
#     ```

#     **Valid Categories** (choose one based on content):
#     - Overview: General app purpose or features (e.g., "What is the SFA app?").
#     - Login: Authentication or login processes (e.g., "How do I log in?").
#     - Meetings: Creating, scheduling, or managing meetings (e.g., "How to create a meeting?").
#     - Outdoor Duty: Outdoor activities, GPS tracking, routes (e.g., "How to start Outdoor Duty?").
#     - Expenses: Expense logging or approval (e.g., "How to add expenses?").
#     - Clients/Leads: Managing clients or leads (e.g., "How to create a new client?").
#     - Follow-Ups: Follow-up meeting actions (e.g., "How to reschedule a meeting?").
#     - Attendance: Attendance tracking (e.g., "How to mark attendance?").

#     **Instructions**:
#     1. **Split the Input**: If the paragraph contains information about multiple topics, questions, or answers, split it into separate entries. Each entry should focus on a single question and answer pair.
#     2. **Extract Question and Answer**: For each entry, identify the question and answer. If not explicitly labeled, infer them from the content.
#     3. **Select Category**: Choose the most relevant category for each entry from the list above.
#     4. **Generate Keywords**: Extract 3â€“10 keywords for each entry that capture its core concepts.
#     5. **Set Source**: Always set `source` to "sfa_faq".
#     6. **Output**: Return a JSON array (list) of objects, each matching the schema above (without the `id` field). Do NOT merge multiple topics into one entry.

#     **Example Input**:
#     "SFA stands for Salesforce Automation. It is a digital tool that helps sales teams manage their activities, including tracking client visits, scheduling meetings, recording expenses, and managing tasks. To log in to the SFA application, users need to enter their credentials and the Company Identifier."

#     **Example Output**:
#     ```json
