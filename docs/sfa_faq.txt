The Sales Force Automation (SFA) application is designed to track client visits, schedule meetings, record expenses, and manage salesforce tasks digitally. Users, including Admins and Managers, log in using their Employee ID, Password, and Company Identifier, which links credentials to a specific organization, by tapping the "Login" button. 

To start or stop Outdoor Duty (OD), users tap the “Toggle Button” on the Dashboard. Creating a meeting for every client visit is essential as it logs the visit and calculates travel distance for tracking and reporting. To create a meeting for an existing client, users tap “Meeting”, press (+), select “Existing Client”, choose the client, and enter meeting details after the meeting ends. For a new client, users tap “Meeting”, press (+), select “New Client”, fill in client details, save, and submit the meeting details. The 'Mark Meeting Without Info' feature allows marking a meeting at a location without entering client or meeting details, with default information saved automatically. Follow-up meetings can be scheduled during the meeting entry process.

Meeting-wise expenses are added by going to the Meeting list, selecting a meeting, tapping “Add Expense”, filling in details, and submitting. Users can view the route taken during OD meetings via a “Route” option that displays the OD path on a map. To create a new lead or client, users navigate to “Leads/Clients”, tap (+), fill in required fields, and tap “Add Lead/Client”. Updating an existing lead or client involves selecting the lead/client, tapping “Edit” on the top right, modifying details, and tapping “Update”. Branches can be added to an existing client using the “Branch” option while editing.

Future meetings are scheduled from the Leads/Clients list by choosing the client, tapping “Schedule Meeting”, entering details, and submitting. Admins and Managers can assign meetings to other users via a dropdown. The Follow-Ups section allows users to view, reschedule, cancel, or reassign previously scheduled follow-up meetings. Meetings can only be rescheduled if the assigned user hasn’t started OD and the meeting time hasn’t begun. Rescheduling is done by going to Follow-Ups, selecting a meeting, tapping “Reschedule”, filling in details, and submitting. To cancel a meeting, users go to Follow-Ups, select the meeting, tap “Cancel”, provide a cancellation remark, and submit. Managers can reassign meetings from the Follow-Ups section by selecting a meeting, tapping “Re-assign”, choosing a user, and submitting.

Day-wise expenses are added by going to the “Expenses” section, tapping (+), entering details, and submitting. Users can filter and view approved or rejected expenses in the Expenses section. Only Managers or Approvers can approve or reject expenses, with partial approvals allowed for individual expenses but not cumulative totals. Creating a new client requires details such as Client Name, Contact Number, Email, Address, and optionally GST details. The system supports uploading client images and meeting photos if required by the company.

GPS tracking is mandatory for OD and meetings to calculate distance traveled and log actual meeting locations. If GPS is turned off or unavailable, users must enable it manually; otherwise, the app may not allow proceeding. Users can view a summary of OD activities, including start and end times, meeting count, and distance covered. Meetings can be filtered by Date, Client, Status (Pending/Completed), and Meeting Type. The 'Mark Without Meeting Info' feature enables field agents to quickly mark their location when client or meeting details are unavailable. Submitted meetings cannot be edited, but users can request a manager’s review or log a follow-up. Distance and travel expenses are calculated using GPS tracking, with expenses linked to OD and meetings for accountability.
